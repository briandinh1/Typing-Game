Typing game inspired by Ztype. Written with C# scripts in Unity

Player has to type the words on the screen before they reach the bottom. 
Implemented randomized words generation of short, medium, and long length. Word fall rate is also randomized with a variance of 0.5.
The words start falling slowly but speed up faster and faster over time. Player has 3 strikes before they lose. Game resets after 3 seconds
